## Welcome to the Data Model Evaluation Website!
I specialise in assisting individuals and companies to choose the best data model for their dataset.

### What problem do I solve?

I use the dataset you provide along with your business problem or opportunity to help to choose the right data model for you! I use my knowlegede of algoritmns and how they perform. For example, Logistic Regression Models is a binary classification algorithm used when the response variable is dichotomous (1 or 0). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which assumes that the covariance of the independent variables is equal across all classes. I then use tools such as Jupyter Notebook in Python to perform an analysis.

What separates my business from other competitors?

My services are easy, reliable, cost effective and I provide individualised support! All you need to do is:

# Identify dataset to want to be analyzed 
## Write down what questions you need the analysis to answer
### Leave the rest to me!

- Python will be used to extract data and perform LDA and Logistical Regression.
- Optimized LDA Model results will be compared to the Optimized Logistical Regression results
- I will make reccommendations on which model is best for you to use!

```


### Reports I Use to Aid My Analysis

1. Pandas Report
2. Classification Report
