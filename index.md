## Welcome to the Data Model Evaluation Website!
I specialise in assisting individuals and companies to choose the best data model for their dataset.

### Models to be Evaluated

Logistic Regression Models is a binary classification algorithm used when the response variable is dichotomous (1 or 0). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which assumes that the covariance of the independent variables is equal across all classes.


```markdown
Steps to follow

# Identify dataset to want to be analyzed 
## Write down what questions you need the analysis to answer
### Leave the rest to me!

- Python will be used to extract data and perform LDA and Logistical Regression.
- Optimized LDA Model results will be compared to the Optimized Logistical Regression results
- I will make reccommendations on which model is best for you to use!

```
